            This application is being built from the ground up as a senior design project. Every fall, the Kansas State University College of Engineering
            hosts a programming competition for high school students at various levels. Currently, everything logistical is being handled on paper
            or is being entered manually into a spread sheet. This website seeks to automate student and worker registration, report scores in real time to
            judges and administrators, and store information and performance statistics from previous events to show progress.
